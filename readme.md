https://mjai.ekyu.moe/ is a website for reviewing online Mahjong games. The reports are available in human readable html. The reports are not easily machine readable. This tool parses the html into a machine readable format. The motivation was to calculate the players average loss per decision.

Use [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to compile. Run it with the first argument being the path to an html report file.
